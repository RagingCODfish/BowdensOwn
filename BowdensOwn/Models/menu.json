We'd recommend grabbing one of our lids (available in 2 colour options) as they're a great place to keep your microfibre off the ground when detailing so you don't get errant dirt and grit in the cloths. Adding a lid also makes the bucket a safe and sealed, dust free spot to store your Microfibre in when you're not using it.",
